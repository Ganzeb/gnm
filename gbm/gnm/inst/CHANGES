Changes in gnm 0.8-0
=======================

New Features
------------

    o	added method = "model.matrix" to gnm() so that model matrix can be
	obtained much faster. The new method is used in model.matrix.gnm() and 
	summary.gnm() (in the calculation of the variance-covariance matrix)

    o	added new utility function residSVD(), to facilitate the calculation
        of good starting values for parameters in certain Mult() terms

    o	added new dataset House2001, to illustrate the use of gnm in 
        Rasch-type scaling of legislator votes

Improvements
------------

    o	gnm() now takes less time to run due to improvements made in internal 
	functions.

    o   the fitting algorithm used by gnm() now copes better with zero-valued 
        residuals.

    o	output given by gnm() when 'trace' = TRUE or 'verbose' = TRUE is now 
	displayed as it is generated on console-based versions of R. 	
	
Changes in Behaviour
--------------------

    o	start-up iterations now only update column of design matrix required in 
	next iteration. Therefore plug-in functions using the default start-up 
	procedure for nonlinear parameters need a localDesignFunction() with the 
	argument 'ind' specifying the column that should be returned.

    o	modified output given by gnm() when 'trace' = TRUE: now prints initial
	deviance and the deviance at the end of each iteration.

    o	modified updates of linear parameters in starting procedure: now offset 
	contribution of fully specified terms only.

    o	updated plot.gnm() to include option 'which' = 5 as in plot.lm() in 
   	R >= 2.2.0. Now has separate help page.

    o	results of summary.gnm(), vcov.gnm() and coef.gnm() now include any 
	eliminated parameters. Print methods have been added for vcov.gnm and 
	coef.gnm objects so that any eliminated parameters are not shown.

Bug Fixes
---------

    o	fixed bug in summary.gnm(), anova.gnm(), termPredictors.gnm() and 
	model.matrix.gnm() where search for model variables was incorrect. 

    o	fixed bug preventing estimation of weights in Dref() terms.

    o	corrected options for 'method' argument in gnm() help file: replaced 
	method = "coef" with method = "coefNames".

    o	fixed bug in gnm() so that it can handle tables with missing values when
  	formatting components of fit.

    o	hatvalues.gnm() now works for objects produced from table data.

    o	residuals.gnm() now returns table not matrix when 'type' = "deviance" 
	for "gnm" objects produced from table data.

    o	hatvalues.gnm(), cooks.distance.gnm() and plot.gnm() now handle cases 
	which are fitted exactly (giving a hat value of 1).

    o	example fitting proportional odds model in backPain help file now works.

    o	fixed bug in Mult() terms so that an offset can be added to a constituent
  	multiplier without an unspecified intercept being added also.


Changes in gnm 0.7-2
=======================

Improvements
------------

    o	Extended use of the 'eliminate' argument of gnm() to allow crossed 
	factors - this also fixes bug which occurred when interactions were 
	eliminated in the presence of lower order terms involving other factors 

Changes in Behaviour
--------------------

    o	'vcov' returned by gnm() now has no rank attribute (as before, the
	rank is returned as the separate component 'rank').

Bug Fixes
---------

    o	Changed the calculation of 'df.residual' returned by gnm() to 
	correctly take account of zero-weighted observations (as in glm()).

    o	When gnm() is called with arguments x = TRUE or VCOV = TRUE, the 
	returned matrices now include columns of zeros for constrained 
	parameters.

    o	Corrected evaluation of model frame in gnm() so that if data is missing, 
	variables are taken from environment(formula), as documented. Modified 
	evaluation of plug-in functions to be consistent with this, i.e. 
	objects are taken from environment(formula) if not in model frame.

    o	MPinv() now checks that the diagonal elements of an `eliminate'd 
	submatrix are all non-zero and reports an error otherwise.



Changes in gnm 0.7-1
=======================

New Features
------------

    o	Topo() introduced for creating topological interaction factors.

    o	anova() implemented for objects of class c("gnm", "glm").


Improvements
------------

    o	Diagnostic messages given by gnm() have been improved.

    o	Step-halving introduced in main iterations of gnm() to ensure deviance 
	is reduced at every iteration.

    o	getContrasts() now (additionally) reports quasi standard errors, when
	available.

    o	Calls to gnm() plug-in functions are now evaluated in the environment 
	of the model frame and the enclosing environment of the parent frame 
	of the call to gnm(). This means that variables can be found in a 
	more standard fashion.


Changes in Behaviour
--------------------

    o	The 'data' argument of Nonlin() is defunct: Nonlin() now identifies 
	variables to be added to the model frame as those passed to unspecified
	arguments of the plug-in function or those identified by a companion 
	function to the plug-in, which is of a specified format.

    o	The (optional) 'start' object returned by a plug-in function can no 
	longer be a function, only a vector. However it may now include NA 
	values, to indicate parameters which may be treated as linear for the 
	purpose of finding starting values, given the non-NA values.


Bug Fixes
---------

    o	The 'eliminate' argument of gnm() now handles functions of variables in 
	the given formula e.g. ~ strata(A, B), ~ as.factor(A):as.factor(B), etc. 

    o	gnm() was giving an error for models with either no linear parameters, 
	or none specified by the 'start' argument, this is now fixed.

    o	Long calls to plug-in functions caused problems in parsing the model 
	formula: now fixed.

    o	gnm() now only restarts after failing if there are unspecified nonlinear
	parameters.

    o	gnm() now returns NULL if model fails.

    o	Bug fixed in calculation of starting values for gnm() that occurred when some
	parameters were constrained.
